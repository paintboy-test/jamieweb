    <h1>Ubuntu Phone Review</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Wednesday 9th September 2015</b></p>
    <p>I got my Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition phone a few weeks ago, so I thought I'd leave my comments and suggestions here for anybody else who is considering purchasing one.</p>
    <p>I ordered my phone on a Thursday, and it had arrived by the next Monday. The estimated delivery was over 2 weeks, but it only took 4 days. The phone appeared to be shipped from Italy, to Germany and then into Leeds Bradford Airport.</p>
    <p>My home address turned out to be incorrect though, and the courier had to phone me to ask for the correct one. My normal English street name had been replaced with an Italian name like "Alberto Ave 6" or something like that.</p>
    <p>I switched to the Ubuntu Phone away from a 32GB Apple iPhone 4.</p>
    <p>The box was just the standard Meizu MX4 packaging, with an Ubuntu Sticker on the front. Inside, everything is branded for the Flyme version of the phone, but that's fine. The box contained a small piece of card with a thank you note from Canonical, which was a nice touch.</p>
    <p>The device itself is very sleek, well built, and doesn't feel cheap at all. The screen is fantastic quality, with a resolution of 1152x1920, it's actually a larger resolution than most modern computer monitors. The colours stand out and are very vibrant. The default Ubuntu Touch lock screen wallpaper does not show off the phone to its full potential. I use the default Flyme wallpaper, which is much more vibrant and colourful. (http://bbsimg.res.flyme.cn/forum/201506/27/164209dr8chzmcjqdlqiis.png)</p>
    <p>After the first boot, I had to set up WiFi, location, etc, and then I was shown a little tutorial on the various gestures on the phone. The gestures work very well with the phone and are easy to do. There was a 400mb update to do straight away, which fixed a few things such as the Ubuntu store not working, as well as adding the ability to create WiFi hotspots. The phone boots very quickly compared to an iPhone.</p>
    <p>The Ubuntu Touch interface works well on a large screen device, with everything fitting in very well. The multitasking switcher is quick and easy, and the notification centre's quick reply feature is exceedingly useful. The Unity launcher that can be dragged out from the left of the phone works just like the desktop version of Ubuntu. You can pin apps, rearrange them, etc.</p>
    <p>There are quite a few apps available, but nothing like that of the Apple App Store or Google Play. All of the essentials are there, but if you are very social and require SnapChat, WhatsApp, etc, then you're out of luck. A lot of the apps come in the form of web apps, which basically display the mobile version of a website in a full window, without the interface of a web browser surrounding it. These work well for sites like Imgur, Reddit, OMG! Ubuntu, etc.</p>
    <p>The call quality is good, text messaging works well and the 4G is blazing fast. The loudspeaker for calls, text alerts, music, etc is extremely loud, much louder than my iPhone's speaker. It's good quality, but nothing special.</p>
    <p>On my first day of using the phone, I was very disappointed with the battery life, it was draining very quickly, even while in sleep mode, and would barely last a full day without been dangerously low. After a few charge cycles and a software update, it is now exceptionally good, much better than my iPhone's battery. I've been using it for 5 days since the last charge with light to moderate usage, powered on 24/7, and it's on 13% battery.</p>
    <p>Another cool thing is that the home button ring is actually slightly glow-in-the-dark. I was very confused the first time I saw this, but I checked and it does have a slight glow to it in a dark room.</p>
    <p><b>Problems:</b></p>
    <ul><li>As of the latest update, I am unable to answer calls. When I receive a call and the answer/decline buttons appear, the touch screen seems to completely stop working. The only way to fix this is for the person to stop ringing you, or for you to reboot your phone. This needs fixing, because at the moment I can't use my phone as a proper phone. We could just call it "The Ubuntu", since the "Phone" bit isn't working at the moment.</li></ul>
    <p><b>Suggestions:</b></p>
    <ul><li>Gesture wake up, so you can double tap or swipe the screen while it is locked in order to wake up the phone without pressing any buttons.</li><br>
    <li>Some way to lock the phone without pressing any physical buttons. In other phones that I have had, physical buttons have usually been the first point of failure (Especially iPhones, the home buttons go all hard and un-pressable after years of usage, deeming the phone pretty much unusable).</li><br>
    <li>Ability to choose if the volume rocker switch is active when the phone is in sleep mode. Sometimes it's useful to have the switch active, but other times it is not, so the choice would be nice.</li><br>
    <li>A way to rearrange the icons on the apps screen, and folders. The default alphabetical view should still be available though, on a different tab or something.</li><br>
    <li>Scheduled silent mode, like Do Not Disturb mode on iOS and Android.</li></ul>
    <p>Overall I am very happy with it. Luckily I don't recieve many calls so I can get by without the phone working for the time being. If you're a dedicated Ubuntu user, then I definitely recommend this. If you're not, then you should consider it, but for day-to-day usage, maybe something like the OnePlus would be better for you. I definitely won't be going back to my iPhone any time soon.</p>
